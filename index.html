	<h1>why is there discrimination aginst the homeless?</h1>
  	<p>
   The reason why there is discriminatio agist homeless people is because that people look at them and automatically think they are lazy because he doesnt have a job or even a family to take care of. That might happen because he might have got a divorce and his partner won the battle or he might have got fired from a job and now doesnt have enough to support himself. p>
